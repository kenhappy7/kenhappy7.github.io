	Ah, the appeal of curves and other flowing shapes. They have their place in the heart of just about any visual designer, but when it comes to text flows on the Web, everything's been on the straight and boring, thanks to table cells, element boxes, and all that other stuff. Until now, anyway. Yes, the text is flowing along with the curve&mdash;not perfectly in step, I admit, but pretty close. And you thought Web design was all about straight lines and boxes.

	<h2>Gently Floating...</h2>
	<p>
	All I did to make this happen was create a 100x100 image of a curve. Then I sliced it up into five strata, each one 10 or 20 pixels tall (depending on the stratum) and only as wide as necessary to show the curve without any clipping.
	</p>
	<p>
	Stack all five strata together (without the borders, of course) and we get the same curve I started with. But float those five strata so that they stack up, and text can flow around them, and their decreasing width allows the text to roughly follow the curve.  A right margin helps keep the text away from the curve; the greater the margin value, the further away text will be pushed from the curve.
