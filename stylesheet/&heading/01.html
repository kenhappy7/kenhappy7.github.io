	<h1 class="punch">Hi.</h1>
	<p>
		Kat and I have just returned from <a href="http://www.morimotorestaurant.com/" title="Morimoto Restaurant">Morimoto</a>, where we had one of the most amazing meals of our entire lives.  Although we&#8217;d been seated at a table to start, Kat decided (and rightly so) that we should move to the sushi bar.  So with a little help from the hostess, we moved to sit at the end of the bar, just a few feet from Morimoto himself, and after a bit of debate we decided to start out with the seared kobe beef and green tea soba noodles.  These were by themselves amazing, but they were just the beginning.  From there, we moved into the <i>omakase</i>, or chef&#8217;s tasting menu.  The best part of this was that we were seated right in front of the chef who was creating our meal, a sushi chef by the name of Alex, so we could ask questions and make requests while he prepared our courses.  And what did we have?
